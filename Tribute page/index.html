        <h2 class="bio-heading">Who is Satyajit Ray?</h2>
        <p> Satyajit Ray, an Indian filmmaker and among the dozen or so great masters of world cinema, is known for his
            humanistic approach to cinema.
            He made his films in Bengali, a language spoken in West Bengal, the eastern state of India, and Bangladesh.
            Satyajit Ray was born to Sukumar Ray and Suprabha Ray (nee Das Gupta) in Calcutta (now Kolkata). Sukumar Ray
            died when Satyajit was two years old. Ray grew up in the house of his grandfather, Upendrakishore Ray
            Chowdhury, and of his printing press. He was attracted by the machines and process of printing from an early
            age, and took particular interest in the production process of Sandesh, a children's magazine started by
            Upendrakishore Ray Chowdhury. Ray studied at Ballygunge Government High School in Calcutta, and completed
            his BA in economics at Presidency College, Calcutta (then affiliated with the University of Calcutta).
            During his school days, he saw a number of Hollywood productions in cinema.
